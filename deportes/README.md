Me encanta esto :) :
>[Take] the average possession of the Lakers. They were going to score .98 points every time they had a possession. [Yet] Kobe Bryant only shot the left handed pull up jumper at a 44 percent clip. So every time that he went left and shot that pull up jumper he was generating .88 points per possession. Well that’s a tenth of a point less than the average Laker possession. And so if I could make him do that time and time again which is a lot tougher to do than to say, I’m shaving off a tenth of a point every single time. I’m actually making him detrimental to his team.
